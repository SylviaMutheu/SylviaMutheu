## ⚙️ Methodology Note

I utilize a variety of project management tools depending on the client, team, and complexity of the project. My preferred methodology is **Agile**, particularly **Scrum**, where I facilitate daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. I’m experienced in managing multiple high-impact projects simultaneously, keeping the team on track while adapting to evolving priorities and delivery contexts. I'm also highly adaptable and open to using other frameworks like **Kanban**, **Hybrid Agile**, or **Waterfall** depending on the project requirements.
